# Project Overview

This project was completed in Tableau Desktop. The purpose of this project was to find the perfect region for Intel to build a new data center. To determine this, several important factors had to be visualized such as energy supply vs. energy demand, the percentage of renewable energy, and more. I then finished off the project by creating a dashboard to highlight the data and recommended a region for Intel to build its new data center. A list of tasks that I completed in this project include:

- Created calculated fields for key metrics such as net production and the percentage of renewable energy
- Connected a calculated field named Period with a parameter that selects the period so that the user can control what period of time (day, week, month) they're viewing
- Created a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, a dual-axis chart and a tree map
- Created a well-organized dashboard to present key points in the data
- Made the dashboard responsive, the user can select the region and period they'd like to look at
- Provided Intel with a data-driven business recommendation to build its new data center in the Northwest region
